in these blocks:
{color_shading
	{shade_tone 0xff431300}
	{intensity 0.05}
}

colour is multiplied by shade_tone
intensity controls the lerp factor (0 -> source colour, 1 -> only shade_tone, between -> interpolated)


{color_correction
	{tone 0xff000032}
	{tone_strength 0.1}
	
	
tone is added additively to the colour, clamped to 255
not sure about tone_strength, probably a factor for the tone
